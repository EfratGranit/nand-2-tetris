# nand-2-tetris
Project solutions for the Nand to Tetris course.

## Course
The best way to understand how a computer works is to built one from scratch. And that is exactly what Nand to Tetris course does. The course leads students through 12 projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy. Throughout the processes students gain invaluable hands-on knowledge in the following areas:

Hardware architecture,
Operating systems,
Programming languages,
Compilers,
Data structures,
Algorithms, and
Software engineering.
Itâ€™s a fantastic course and I highly recommend it.

## Repository
This repository contains my Nand to Tetris project solutions. The course is comprised of two parts, hardware and software. Each part contains six projects that are self-contained in accordance with the abstraction principle.

## Project solutions
### Part I: The hardware
First part is dedicated to the design and implementation of a computer hardware named Hack. The repository contains hardware solutions to the following projects.

</br>Project 01: Boolean Logic
</br>Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic
</br>Project 03: Sequential Logic
</br>Project 04: Machine Language
</br>Project 05: Computer Architecture
</br>Project 06: Assembler
### Part II: The software 
Second part starts with the virtual machine design, implements a high level object oriented language called Jack, and ends with compiler and the operating system. The repository contains software solutions to the following projects.

</br>Project 07: Virtual Machine, Stack Arithmetic
</br>Project 08: Virtual Machine, Program Control
</br>Project 09: High-Level Language
